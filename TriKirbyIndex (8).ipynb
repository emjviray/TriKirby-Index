    "## Methodology: TriKirby Index (Percentile-Based Command Metric)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The **TriKirby Index** is a pitch-level command metric designed to quantify a pitcher’s ability to consistently repeat release direction and release location. The metric extends the original Kirby Index framework by operating at the **pitch-type level**, normalizing performance **relative to NCAA Division I pitchers**, and producing an interpretable **percentile-based score**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Pitch-Level Data Construction\n",
    "All calculations begin from pitch-level TrackMan data. Each pitch includes measurements of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vertical Release Angle (VRA)\n",
    "- Horizontal Release Angle (HRA)\n",
    "- Vertical Release Location ($vRel$)\n",
    "- Horizontal Release Location ($hRel$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pitch-level data is retained until aggregation to preserve within-pitch variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Pitcher–Pitch Type Aggregation\n",
    "For each pitcher $p$ and pitch type $t$, release consistency is summarized using the **standard deviation** of each release component:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma_{\\text{VRA},p,t}, \\quad\n",
    "\\sigma_{\\text{HRA},p,t}, \\quad\n",
    "\\sigma_{\\text{vRel},p,t}, \\quad\n",
    "\\sigma_{\\text{hRel},p,t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower standard deviation indicates greater command consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Percentile-Based Release Consistency Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "For each pitcher \\( p \\) and pitch type \\( t \\), release consistency is quantified using the\n",
    "within-pitch-type **standard deviation** of four release components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vertical Release Angle (VRA)\n",
    "- Horizontal Release Angle (HRA)\n",
    "- Vertical Release Location (vRel)\n",
    "- Horizontal Release Location (hRel)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower variability indicates greater repeatability and improved pitch command.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure comparability across NCAA Division I pitchers **within each pitch type**, each\n",
    "standard deviation is converted into a percentile-based consistency score:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "- Scores lie in the interval \\( [0,1] \\)\n",
    "- Higher values correspond to **better command**\n",
    "- Each pitch type is normalized independently\n",
    "- Metrics are robust to scale differences across pitch types\n",

    "\n",
    "Each release component contributes differently to overall pitch command.\n",
    "To reflect this, a set of **fixed linear weights** \\( \\beta_i \\) is applied to each percentile-based\n",

    "## 5. Feature Importance via Random Forest Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Each release component does not contribute equally to overall pitch command. To estimate the **relative importance** of each release dimension, the TriKirby Index uses a **Random Forest regression model** rather than fixed linear coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Random Forest model is chosen because it:\n",
    "- Captures **nonlinear relationships** between release mechanics and pitch location outcomes  \n",

    "$$\n",
